                <p>
                    A Member of Congress is a U.S. Representative, who serves in the House of Representatives,
                    or a U.S. Senator, who serves in the Senate. A Member of the House also is called
                    a Congresswoman or Congressman. (Delegates and the Resident Commissioner are nonvoting
                    members of the House.)</p>
                <p>
                    For lists of current Members of the House, visit the <a href="index.aspx.html">

                What are Delegates and the Resident Commissioner? How long do they serve, and what
                do they do?
            </div>
            <div id="sc2" class="switchcontent">
                <p>
                    The office of <strong>Delegate </strong>was established by ordinance of the Continental
                    Congress (1774&ndash;1789) and confirmed by a law of the U.S. Congress. From the
                    beginning of the Republic, the U.S. House of Representatives has admitted Delegates
                    from territories or districts organized by law. There are currently five Delegates,
                    including one from the District of Columbia, and one from each of the following
                    territories:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>American Samoa</li>
                    <li>Guam</li>
                    <li>The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands</li>
                    <li>The Virgin Islands.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Congress created the post of <strong>Resident Commissioner</strong> in 1900 to apply
                    to Puerto Rico. Congress granted a Resident Commissioner to the Philippines several
                    years later. Since 1946, when the Philippines became independent, only Puerto Rico
                    has had a Resident Commissioner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Delegates and Representatives serve a two-year term, and the Resident Commissioner
                    serves a four-year term. In most respects, Delegates and the Resident Commissioner
                    have most of the authority that Members have. On the House Floor, they can speak,
                    introduce bills, and offer amendments. They can serve on House Committees and possess
                    most of the authority that other Committee members have.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Delegates and the Resident Commissioner also may offer amendments while the House
                    is conducting business as the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union.
                    However, unlike Members, they may not vote while the House is conducting business
                    as the Committee of the Whole or vote on the final passage of legislation when the
                    House is meeting.</p>

                Do Members take an Oath of Office when they enter the House?
            </div>
            <div id="sc3" class="switchcontent">
                <p>
                    <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html"
                        target="_blank">Article VI of the U.S. Constitution</a> requires that Members
                    of the U.S. Congress be bound by oath or affirmation to support the Constitution.
                    Members-elect of the U.S. House of Representatives typically take the Oath of Office
                    on the House Floor on the first day of a new Congress, immediately after the Speaker
                    of the House has been elected and sworn in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Speaker administers this oath:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    &ldquo;I, (name of Member), do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and
                    defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic;
                    that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation
                    freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well
                    and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter.
                    So help me God&rdquo; (5 U.S.C. &sect;3331).</blockquote>
                <p>
                    If elected in special elections during the course of a Congress, Representatives,
                    Delegates, and the Resident Commissioner generally take the Oath on the Floor, once
                    the Clerk of the House has received a certificate of election from the appropriate
                    election commission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On rare occasions, because of illness or other such circumstances, a Member-elect
                    has been authorized to take the Oath at a location other than the House, and the
                    Speaker’s designee administers the Oath.</p>

                How are Representatives, Delegates, and the Resident Commissioner nominated and
                elected?
            </div>
            <div id="sc6" class="switchcontent">
                <p>
                    In most states, territories, and the District of Columbia, candidates for the U.S.
                    House of Representatives who are members of major political parties are nominated
                    in a primary election. Some states also provide for a party convention to nominate
                    candidates or to endorse candidates before a primary. In many states, no primary
                    election is held for a particular office if a candidate is unopposed. Minor-party
                    candidates are nominated according to individual party rules and procedures, while
                    Independent candidates are nominated by self-declaration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    States automatically place major-party candidates on the primary ballot. Minor-party
                    and Independent candidates must meet state-specific requirements—such as submitting
                    a petition with the signatures of registered voters—to be placed on the ballot.</p>
                <p>
                    House Members are elected by plurality vote (the largest number of votes received)
                    in the congressional district in which they are candidates. Special cases include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South
                        Carolina, and Texas,</strong> which require that a candidate receive a majority
                        (more than half) of popular votes to be nominated. In these states, a runoff primary
                        election between the top two candidates is held if no candidate receives a majority
                        in the first primary. </li>
                    <li><strong>Louisiana,</strong> which requires that all candidates compete in an &ldquo;open

                    or caucus but can vote for anyone, whether that person has been nominated or not.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To be elected, a candidate must receive an absolute majority of the votes cast—which
                    may be less than a majority of the full House because of vacancies, absentee Members,
                    or Members who vote &quot;present.&quot; If no candidate receives the majority of
                    votes, the roll call is repeated until a majority is reached and the Speaker is
                    elected.

                What are the duties of the House Majority Leader and Minority Leader? Who has served
                in these positions?

                <p>
                    The <strong>Majority Leader</strong> helps plan daily, weekly, and annual legislative
                    agendas for the U.S. House of Representatives and customarily schedules legislative
                    business on the House Floor. The Majority Leader works closely with the Speaker
                    of the House, and communicates and consults with House Members to advance the majority
                    party&rsquo;s legislative goals.</p>
                <p>
                    The <strong>Minority Leader</strong> leads and serves as a spokesperson for the
                    minority party. The Minority Leader chairs the party&rsquo;s steering committee,
                    which is involved in the selection of party members for standing committees, and
                    nominates or appoints the party&rsquo;s members to certain standing committees.
                    The Minority Leader also serves as an <em>ex officio</em> member of the Permanent
                    Select Committee on Intelligence. The Minority Leader directs the party&rsquo;s
                    legislative strategies and operations, in consultation with party colleagues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Majority Leader and Minority Leader—also called party Floor leaders—are selected
                    by the party conference and the party caucus.

                    time at the start of a new Congress, the members of the House Republican Conference

                    one or more chief deputy whips as well as deputy whips, assistant whips, regional
                    whips, and other whips. The Whips are elected or appointed at organizational meetings
                    before the start of a two-year Congress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whips maintain communication between party leadership and party members, build the
                    members&rsquo; support for the leadership’s priorities, and inform and mobilize members
                    on voting on key legislation.

                    A party conference or party caucus is an organizational body of all of a party&rsquo;s members in the U.S. House of Representatives. The terms &ldquo;conference&rdquo; or &ldquo;caucus&rdquo; also can refer to some  <a href="http://cha.house.gov/member-services/congressional-memberstaff-organizations"
                        target="_blank">Congressional Member Organizations</a>, or refer to a meeting that includes all of a party&rsquo;s members in the House.
                </p>
                <p>
                    House Republicans call their organization the House Republican Conference; House
                    Democrats call their organization the House Democratic Caucus. The House Republican
                    Conference and House Democratic Caucus officially elect the parties&rsquo; leaders.
                    The organizations elect their chairs before the start of a new Congress. Typically, each establishes a steering committee or steering and policy committee, which approves assignments of party members to standing committees, as well as establishes task forces.
