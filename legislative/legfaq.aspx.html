                    A new Congress begins at noon January 3 of each odd-numbered year following a general
                    election, unless it designates a different day by law. A Congress lasts for two
                    years, with each year constituting a separate session. The Legislative Reorganization
                    Act of 1970 requires Congress to adjourn sine die no later than July 31 of each
                    year unless there is a declared war, or unless Congress otherwise provides. In odd-numbered
                    years, the Congress must take an August recess if it fails to adjourn by July 31.
                    Neither the House nor the Senate may adjourn for more than three days (excluding
                    Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) without the concurrence of the other Chamber.
                    It has also become a common practice for the Congress to adjourn after making provision
                    for the House and Senate leaders to summon the Congress back into session in emergency
                    circumstances. Similarly, the Constitution grants the President the authority to
                    summon the Congress for a special session if circumstances require.</p>

                    The Speaker calls the House to order, and the Sergeant at Arms places the Mace on
                    the pedestal at the right of the Speaker's platform. After the Chaplain offers a
                    prayer, the Speaker recognizes a Member to lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance.
                    Then the journal of the previous day's activities is approved, usually without being
                    read. Next, the Speaker may recognize a few Members to speak  briefly on matters of importance to them, for no longer than one  minute  each. The House then is ready to begin or resume consideration of a bill,  resolution, or conference report.

                <p>
                    A term of Congress is two years long and begins on January 3 of each odd-numbered year. Each Member of the U.S. House of Representatives is elected to serve for one term at a time, and may be elected later to serve additional terms.</p>
<p>A session of Congress is one year long. Each term has two sessions, which are referred to as &ldquo;1st&rdquo; or &ldquo;2nd.&rdquo; Being &ldquo;in session&rdquo; refers to when Congress is meeting during the session.

                    Congress holds joint sessions to receive addresses from the President and to count
                    electoral ballots for President and Vice President. Congress also holds joint meetings
                    to receive addresses from such dignitaries as foreign heads of state, heads of government,
                    or from distinguished American citizens.</p>

                    In the House, Members stand, address the presiding officer and do not proceed until
                    recognized to speak. The presiding officer (the Speaker of the House, Speaker pro
                    tempore or the chairman in the Committee of the Whole) has the authority to ask
                    Members for what purpose they seek recognition. The presiding officer may then recognize
                    or not recognize the Member, depending upon the purpose for which recognition was

                        on the House floor? </strong>

            </div>

                <p>
                    In the House, a matter may undergo one hour of debate, usually equally divided between
                    the majority and the minority without unanimous consent. Moreover, the majority
                    can call for the "previous question," and bring the pending matter to an immediate
                    vote. Non-legislative debate is limited to one-minute per Member at the beginning
                    of the day and up to one hour per Member at the end of the day. In the Committee
                    of the Whole, the period of time spent in general debate is determined and apportioned
                    in advance. Amendments are subject to the five-minute per side rule, but can extend
                    beyond 10 minutes of debate per amendment. A non-debatable motion to close debate
                    is in order to end debate on any specific amendment and bring it to a vote.

                Congress?
            </div>
            <div id="sc9" class="switchcontent">
                <p>
                    Most votes are taken by a simple voice method, in which the yeas and nays are called
                    out, respectively. It is the judgment of the chair as to which are greater in number
                    determines the vote. If a recorded vote is desired, a sufficient second must support
                    it. The Constitution simply provides that "the yeas and nays of the Members of either
                    House on any question shall at the desire of one-fifth of those present, be entered
                    on the Journal." One-fifth of a quorum is deemed to be 44 in the House (one-fifth
                    of 218). Since 1973, the House has used an electronic voting system to reduced the
                    time consumed in voting, and permits a minimum of 15 minutes to complete a vote.

            <div id="sc10" class="switchcontent">
                <p>
                    A quorum in the House of Representatives is when a majority of the Members are present.
                    When there are no vacancies in the membership, a quorum is 218. When one or more
                    seats are vacant, because of deaths or resignations, the quorum is reduced accordingly.
                    Because of Members' other duties, a quorum often is not present on the House floor.
                    But any Member may insist that a quorum must participate in any vote that takes
                    place in the House. If a Member makes a point of order that a quorum is not present,

                    The provisions of the law take effect immediately unless the law itself provides
                    for another date. The law will also specify which executive departments or agencies
                    are empowered to carry it out or enforce it. The actual written document is sent
                    to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), an independent government
                    agency, where it is given a number and published in individual form as a "slip law."
                    At the end of each session of Congress, these are consolidated in a bound volume

                    in force are included in the Code of Laws of the United States of America, commonly
                    called the U.S. Code. The Office of Law Revision Counsel, part of the institutional

                    The Constitution (Article I, Section 8) empowers the Congress to levy taxes, collect
                    revenue, pay debts and provide for the general welfare; borrow money; regulate interstate
                    and foreign commerce; establish uniform rules of naturalization and bankruptcy;
                    coin money and regulate its value; punish counterfeits; establish a postal system;
                    enact patent and copyright laws; establish Federal courts inferior to the Supreme
                    Court; declare war; provide for Armed Forces; impeach and try Federal officers (Section
                    2 and 3); and to have exclusive legislative power over the District of Columbia.
                    In Article II, Section 2, the Senate is given the power to consent to ratification
                    of treaties and confirm the nomination of public officials. Congress is also given
                    the power to enact such laws as may be "necessary and proper" to implement its mandate
                    in Article I, and in certain amendments to the Constitution.

                    The Constitution (Article I, Section 5) provides that each House "determine the
                    Rules of its Proceedings." These resulting rules and procedures are spelled out
                    in detailed procedural manuals for each Chamber.

                    By Constitutional requirement, the House keeps a journal of its proceedings. The

                    proceedings of the Chamber. In addition, the House <i>Journal</i> contains minimal
                    information about actions taken by the House when meeting as a Committee of the
                    Whole, because any action taken there is not official unless and until it is ratified
