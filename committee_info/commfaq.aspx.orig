            <div id="sc1" class="switchcontent">
                <p>
                    <a name="Q1"></a>The Committee of the Whole House is a committee of the House on
                    which all Representatives serve and which meets in the House Chamber for the consideration
                    of measures from the Union calendar. However, it is governed by different rules
                    of procedure than the House meeting as itself. The concept of the &quot;grand committee&quot;
                    has been carefully developed from the early days of the House and in modern practice
                    gives the House a more expeditious means for considering the complex and often controversial
                    legislation referred to it.
                    <br />
                </p>
                <p>
                    Historically it was devised by the English House of Commons to give them the ability
                    to debate privately and not have their votes committed to record. The Committee
                    of the Whole in the U.S. House, however, has permitted recorded votes since January
                    1971. The House resolves itself into a new Committee of the Whole for the consideration
                    of a bill. A specific Committee of the Whole is dissolved when it &quot;rises and
                    reports with a recommendation,&quot; to the House. When the Committee rises after
                    not having resolved the matter committed to it, that bill is carried on the calendar
                    as &quot;unfinished business of the Committee of the Whole&quot; until consideration
                    has been finally completed.</p>

            <div id="sc2" class="switchcontent">
                Standing committees are permanent panels identified in Chamber rules, which also
                list the jurisdiction of each committee. Because they have legislative jurisdiction,
                standing committees consider bills and issues and recommend measures for consideration
                by the House. They also have oversight responsibilities to monitor agencies, programs,
                and activities within their jurisdictions, and in some cases in areas that cut across
                committee jurisdictions. Most standing committees recommend authorized levels of
                funds for government operations and for new and existing programs within their jurisdiction,
                but a few have other functions.

                committees selected?
            </div>
            <div id="sc4" class="switchcontent">
                <p>
                    Before Members are assigned to committees, each committee's size and the proportion
                    of Republicans to Democrats must be decided by the party leaders. The total number
                    of committee slots allotted to each party is approximately the same as the ratio
                    between majority party and minority party members in the full Chamber.
                    <br />
                </p>
                <p>
                    Members are then assigned to committees in a three-step process. Each of the two
                    principle parties in the House is responsible for the assigning its members to committees,
                    and at the first stage, each party uses a committee on committees to make the initial
                    recommendations for assignments. At the beginning of the new Congress, Members express
                    preferences for assignment to the appropriate committee on committees. Most incumbents
                    prefer to remain on the same committees so as not to forfeit expertise and committee
                    seniority. These committees on committees then match preferences with committee
                    slots, following certain guidelines designed in part to distribute assignments fairly.
                    They then prepare and approve an assignment slate for each committee, and submit
                    all slates to the appropriate full party conference for approval. Approval at this
                    second stage often is granted easily, but the conferences have procedures for disapproving
                    recommended Members and nominating others in their stead. Finally, at the third
                    stage, each committee submits its slate to the pertinent full Chamber for approval,
                    which is generally granted.

                committee of the House?</div>
            <div id="sc5" class="switchcontent">
                Each House committee is authorized to establish its own quorum requirement for the
                transaction of business. House rules specify that House committees shall have at
                least two members present to take testimony or receive evidence and at least one-third
                of the members present for taking any other action, except reporting out a bill
                to the floor. However, a physical majority of the committee members must be present
                to report a bill to the floor.

            </div>
            <div id="sc6" class="switchcontent">
                <p>
                    Select committees usually are established by a separate resolution of the parent
                    chamber, sometimes to conduct investigations and studies, sometimes to consider
                    measures. Often one is established because the existing standing committee system
                    does not address an issue comprehensively, or because a particular event sparks
                    interest in an investigation. A select committee may be permanent or temporary.
                    Special committees, and more rarely, undesignated committees, tend to be similar
                    in constitution and function.

                <p>
                    Joint committees are made up of members of both chambers. Today, they usually are
                    permanent panels that conduct studies or perform housekeeping tasks rather than
                    consider measures. A conference committee is a temporary joint committee formed
                    to resolve differences in Senate-passed and House-passed versions of a particular
                    measure.

                <p>
                    Most committees form subcommittees with legislative jurisdiction to consider and
                    report bills in particular issues within the purview of the full committee. Committees
                    may assign their subcommittees such specific tasks as the initial consideration
                    of measures and oversight of laws and programs in their areas. Subcommittees are
                    responsible to and work with guidelines established by their parent committees.
                    Consequently, their number, independence, and autonomy vary among committees.

                <p>
                    Committees frequently hold hearings to receive testimony from individuals not on
                    the committee. Hearings may be for legislative, oversight, or investigative purposes.
                    Legislative hearings are those addressing measures before the committee, and they
                    may address many measures on a given subject. Oversight hearings focus on the implementation
                    and administration of programs created by law. Many committees perform oversight
                    when reauthorizing funds for a program, which may occur annually. Investigative
                    hearings often address allegations of wrongdoing by public officials or private
                    citizens, or determine the facts of a major disaster or crisis. Oversight and investigative
                    hearings may lead to the introduction of legislative proposals.

                <p>
                    Following legislative hearings, a committee decides whether to report a measure,
                    in which case it chooses a specific measure and perfects it through amendment. A
                    business meeting for this purpose is called a markup. Both chambers require a minimum
                    quorum of one-third of a committee's members to hold a markup session, and some
                    committees establish a higher one. The process may be formal for controversial measures
                    or relaxed for ones less contentious. In leading a markup, the chairman generally
                    chooses the legislative vehicle, and presents it for consideration and amendment.
                    This vehicle may be an introduced bill, or another version prepared by committee
                    staff at the direction of the chair. Many individuals attempt to influence the content
                    of measures, sometimes suggesting alternative language. A Member may offer an amendment
                    containing alternative language, and a majority of a quorum is needed to adopt an
                    amendment.

                    A reported measure usually is accompanied by a written document, called a report,
                    describing the measure's purposes and provisions and telling Members why this version
                    has been reported and why it should be passed. The report reflects the views of
                    a majority of the committee, but also may contain minority, supplemental, or additional
                    views of committee members. It usually includes estimates of the legislation's cost
                    if it were to become law, various statements of its impact and application, a section-by-section
                    analysis, and a comparison with existing law. Officials of the executive and judicial
                    branches of government use these reports to determine the legislative history of
                    laws and Congress' intent in enacting them. FDsys-GPO Access contains <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collection.action?collectionCode=CRPT" target='_blank'>
